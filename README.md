### Hi People ðŸ‘‹, greets you William Mosquera ~ WjmmK
#### Considerations
- This is a simple project to show how to use a simple API to get data from a RESTful API with Microservices.

The databases exposed are: storeDB Folder.

-mysql.js // this is the connection to the database of the General API.
// this is the connection to the Micro-Services database.
-remoteConstructor.js
-remoteMySql.js
-etc.
